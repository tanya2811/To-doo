So i have created this to-do application its features are that a task gets added deleted and modified in it.
Talking about the folder structure its simple and efficient every thing is sorted. 
Here we have node modules
a basic index.js file where the server is created and all CRUD operations are performed
Then for frontend we have used EJS folder--> view and file --> home.ejs
For designing the application we have made folder --> style and file --> style.css
For database connection we have folder --> congfig and file --> mongoose.js
For validation of content we have folder --> models and file --> list.js
For backend i have used mongoDb compass where all data is stored we can add tasks to it and after that can updae the status as to done.
